## 👋 About Me

Frontend Engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable, data-heavy web applications using React and TypeScript.

My experience includes developing applications from scratch, refactoring large legacy codebases, and migrating projects to modern frontend stacks. I’m regularly involved in architectural decisions such as application structure, component boundaries, state management, data flow, and integration patterns, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and understandable as the product grows.

I’ve designed modular frontend architectures, internal UI kits, and shared patterns that allow teams to move faster without breaking things. Along the way, I’ve worked on data-heavy interfaces, real-time features, and mapping solutions.

Core technologies:<br />
React, Vue 3, TypeScript, Next.js, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, TanStack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, SCSS, Git, CI/CD
